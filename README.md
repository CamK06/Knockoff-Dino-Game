# Dino Game
A terrible implementation of the Chrome dino game written in C++ with SFML. Once again because I'm bored in class

## Build
Install SFML with your respective package manager and run the following in the cloned repo folder:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Running
Copy the res folder to the same directory as the executable, then run the executable: `./dino`
